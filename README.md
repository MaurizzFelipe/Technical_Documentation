# RENTCAST REAL ESTATE AND PROPERTY DATA SAMPLE

## Introduction to RentCast Real Estate And Property Data

Our US Property Data API Connector streamlines the process of accessing and analyzing property records and sales transactions for over 140 million US properties. Offering a user-friendly interface, this connector simplifies the extraction, transformation, and secure loading of property data into your Snowflake data warehouse. [insert share/reference here]

In today's data-driven real estate landscape, organizations often face challenges in effectively accessing and analyzing up to date property data. Many real estate professionals resort to manual data gathering, laborious web scraping or subscribing to expensive data feeds. But these approaches are either very inefficient or very expensive and challenging to set up.

With the GetOurData Property API connector, organizations can overcome these challenges effortlessly. After a simple one-time setup, the connector automates the extraction and synchronization of property records, sales transactions and rental listing data and benchmarks and loads target datasets to your Snowflake warehouse ready for analysis. No need for complex data pipelines or manual data gathering processes!

## Easy-button for accessing US property data

No technical skills required. Our connectors abstracts away all the complexities of working with API data sources. Connect your preferred BI tool to the Snowflake database, and jump right into analysis. Behind the scenes our API connectors handle everything automatically and transform raw unstructured API responses into beautifully structured tabular data optimized for analysis.

## Data security 

GetOurData Connectors ensure organizations maintain control over their data. Select your own Snowflake instance as the data destination and our strictly limited permissions only allow us to write finished data to your target database. We cannot see or access anything in your Snowflake environment. After each data refresh completes we automatically purge all work-in-process data packets from our AWS servers, greatly limiting any data risk given the very short duration data processing window -- typically measured in minutes -- that lasts only as long as it takes to query, extract and transform data from each API endpoint. 

The data set is maintained by GetOurData.
